# CliffordCircuits

Efficient simulation of Clifford Circuits via the Gottesman-Knill theorem, using the tableau representation presented by [Aaronson and Gottesman (2004)](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0406196).
The intended application here is to study measurement-induced entanglement transitions in stabilizer codes.

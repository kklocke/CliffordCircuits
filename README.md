# CliffordCircuits

Implementing Aaronson and Gottesmann's tableau algorithm for simulating Clifford circuits with the intended application being to study measurement induced transitions in stabilizer codes.

To Do:
- Reformat into Modules
- Add iPython Notebook for demo + plots
- Look at how to speed up the code.
- Maybe implement a tableau struct so that the code is more readable
